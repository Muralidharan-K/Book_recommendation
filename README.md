# Book_recommendation
 Utilizing data from Goodreads, I developed a Python program for personalized book recommendations. The program analyzes a user's read books, identifies similar readers, and then suggests a book based on the most highly rated and frequently read book by those similar readers. This approach leverages collaborative filtering to provide targeted and relevant book recommendations.
